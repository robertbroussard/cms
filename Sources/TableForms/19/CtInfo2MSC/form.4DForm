					"text": "A Moderated Settlement Conference is a case evaluation process that is designed to encourage early trial settlements.  Counsel present their best cases to an impartial panel of lawyers who evaluate the case and render an advisory non-binding decision for use by the parties in settlement negotiations.  Clients or their authorized representatives attend the conference, and, to the extent agreed upon by their counsel, participate in settlement discussions.  Although formal rules of evidence are generally  followed, the administrative moderator may relax these rules to expedite the cooperative disposition of the proceedings.  All statements and exhibits used in connection with the conference are considered part of the settlement process and, as such, are confidential.  Indeed, the panel reports only to the  appointing judges as to whether the case was settled, and makes no other report except on the parties' mutual agreement.  A summary case sheet is completed by counsel before the Moderated Settlement Conference so that the panel may have the benefit of the parties' contentions before the conference is held.\r\rThe following process stages are outlined as a flexible guide for the moderator panel.  The panel may, of course, decide to vary from this process as appropriate.\r"
